# lab-5-squirrel-data-science

Complete all of the below tasks using Python and the data-science libraries. We are working with two data sets in this lab: a CSV of the parks where the data was taken, and the list of the squirrel observational data. 

Have open in another tab the [Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/03.00-introduction-to-pandas.html) to help you answer the questions. Most of these can be completed in just a handful of lines of code.

## Tasks

**Do each of these tasks as a separate data cell. Explain one observation you make from that data in a text cell**

- Show the first 100 records by using explicit indexing
- Filter the spreadsheet by showing squirrels that quaa'd.
- Filter the spreadsheet by only showing the lines of the spreadsheet that have anecdotes (excluding null rows)
- Display the results by separate seasons ([use this to find a way to determine the seasons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season#Four-season_reckoning)
- Get the average height of all squirrels that were off the ground (you will have to first filter out the results from squirrels on the ground, then average the remaining series)

Mastery
- For any given, get the average number of squirrels per hectare. For more fun, try and find the park with the greatest number of squirrels per hectare!
