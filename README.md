# lab-5-squirrel-data-science

Complete all of the below tasks using Python and the data-science libraries. We are working with two data sets in this lab: a CSV of the parks where the data was taken, and the list of the squirrel observational data.

Have open in another tab the [Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/03.00-introduction-to-pandas.html) to help you answer the questions. Most of these can be completed in just a handful of lines of code.

## Tasks

**Do each of these tasks as a separate data cell. Explain one observation you make from that data in a text cell**

- Show the first 100 records by using explicit indexing
- Filter the spreadsheet by showing squirrels that quaa'd.
- Filter the spreadsheet by only showing the lines of the spreadsheet that have anecdotes (excluding null rows)
- Display the results by separate seasons ([use this to find a way to determine the seasons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season#Four-season_reckoning)
